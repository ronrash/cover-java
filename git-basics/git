git switch main --> swithced to this branch
git checkout -b feature-new --> create and checkout to the new branch
git branch -d feature-a --> -d to delete a branch

Head ??
Head is the latest commit in any  branch
do a git log it will show the latest head -> main origin/main

Detached Head ?
when we checkout a commit and the git is unaware of the commit belongs to which branch,
becoz the same commit can belong to 2 same commits on 2 diff branches
then it is called a detached head

how to handle git detached head ??
git log --> we see c1 c2 c3 commits --> we got to c2 commit --> git checkout c2 --> now we are in detached head on c2 commit??
do git log (HEAD)
git branch --> u will see --> * (HEAD detached at 7453972)
we make our changes in c2 commit detached state  {git add . , git commit -am " detached head commits "}
then we create a new detached branch-->  git branch detached-branch ,, and the switch to orginal branch  here it is main and then merge that detached branch

steps
git checkout <commit-id>  --> checkout to a new commit
git log --> see deatched head
git branch  --> see detached branch
make chanegs and commit in detached state
git add .
git commit -m " detahced commit changes"
git branch detached-head-branch --> create a new branch ths will put all changes to this branch
git switch main --> checkout to main branch
git merge detached-head-branch --> merge this branch to main to get all the changes


checkout a specific commit
git checkout coomit-id --> this may lead to a detached head
to get out of this just checkout to a branhc
git checkout branc-name

undo changes from a file
 git restore .

# stash
git stash
git stash apply

git stash list  -- shows a list of stashed changes

git stash push -m "latest changes"
git stash list

git stash clear --> clears the entire stash

# git reflog
to reset to a commit
git checkout <commit-id>
git restore --staged filename
git log -- check logs
git reset <commitid>

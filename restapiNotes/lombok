Lombok is a Java library that helps reduce boilerplate code by providing annotations to automatically
generate common code structures such as getters, setters, constructors, equals/hashCode methods, and more.

It provides a level of abstraction and hence the developer should be aware of lombok and ts generated code to understand the underlying implementation.

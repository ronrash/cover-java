TestContainers -- Test conatiners are java library that supports




// Testing the web/presentation layer using
The @WebMvcTest annotation in Spring Boot is used for testing a specific controller by loading only the necessary components for testing the web layer.
MockMvc and @MockBean are two important components in Spring Boot testing that facilitate unit testing of controllers.
mockMvc -  class provided by spring which allows us to simulate http request and response for our controller
mockBean - helps us to mock the servic class which itself has a lot of dependencies whihc does not need to be mocked ,,so that we can test the controller in isolations

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @MockBean
    private PersonService personService;

// Testing the service layer
In the example above, @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) enables Mockito's extension for the MyTestClass.
It allows the use of annotations such as @Mock to create mock objects and @InjectMocks to inject the mocks into the class under test (MyClass).

With @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) in place,
 you can use Mockito's features like mocking dependencies, defining mock behaviors, and verifying interactions within your test methods.

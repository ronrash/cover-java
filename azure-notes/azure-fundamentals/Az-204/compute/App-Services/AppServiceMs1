Limitations
App Service on Linux does have some limitations:

App Service on Linux isn't supported on Shared pricing tier.
The Azure portal shows only features that currently work for Linux apps. As features are enabled, they're activated on the portal.
When deployed to built-in images, your code and content are allocated a storage volume for web content, backed by Azure Storage.
The disk latency of this volume is higher and more variable than the latency of the container filesystem.

Apps that require heavy read-only access to content files may benefit from the custom container option,
which places files in the container filesystem instead of on the content volume.

An App Service plan is the scale unit of the App Service apps.
If the plan is configured to run five VM instances, then all apps in the plan run on all five instances.
If the plan is configured for autoscaling, then all apps in the plan are scaled out together based on the autoscale settings.


when to scale up or down
The app is resource-intensive.
You want to scale the app independently from the other apps in the existing plan.
The app needs resource in a different geographical region.

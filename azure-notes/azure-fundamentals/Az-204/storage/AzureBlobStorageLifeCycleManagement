Creating a policy
storage account --> lifecycle managemnet {only for gen purpose v2 and blob storage accounts}==>
add a rule --rulname --> aply rule --> blob type and blob subtype {blob base}
here create rules and create conditions

if base blob was created more than  365ays move to archive storage
if base blob was created more than 365*10 days delete blob

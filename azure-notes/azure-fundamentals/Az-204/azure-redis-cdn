Any time an application receives a request, there's a chance that the operations that are associated
 with that request might take additional time to execute.
A common way to deal with these types of longer-running operations is to add them to a queue,
which is then processed later and maybe even by a different server altogether.
This type of deferment strategy is called task queuing and Azure Cache for Redis serves this purpose well by acting as a distributed queue.

f you need to invalidate the data in your Redis cache use flush command

Cache aside - a strategy in which data items are loaded into the cache only as needed



A content delivery network, which is also known as a CDN,
is a network of distributed servers that's used to more efficiently deliver content to end users.

CDNs do is store cached content on what are called edge servers that are located in specific point-of-presence locations that are near the end users who are consuming the content.
Default ttl is 7 days

Create a cdn resource -- name,
name
cdn-endpoint -- anyname
origgin type -- webapp or storage or
origin hostname -url of the original webserver

Caching rules to referesh cach on cdn based on rules

management groups -- different subscriptions or resources for different groups like qa dev application hr finance

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure Compute services -- Execute the code in the cloud
VMs,Aks,Aci(azure conatiner instance),App Services(web apps)

Virtual Machine -- Infrastruture As Service Iaas  -- Aws EC2 -- its like ur  using ur local machine on cloud
{no of cores ,cpu speed,ram size ,temp disk}

VMss - Virtual Machine Scale Sets - LoadBalancer manages --> 2 or more vms with same configuration running the exact same code and directing traffic to thses
Able to scale based on demand -- like 100 to 1000vms

PAaS - Platform as service -
You give ur code or package ur app and give to azure and they promise to run on whaever server configuration they are using in the background
to run that but promise performance
Its like abstraction to ur vms

Aci
Containers -- ur code is an image and basically it can be copied into ur dev or staging or prod as it is
and the deployement processs is easier.
Container instances are a simpler form and you cannot scale up many machines

Aks -- runs on a cluster of servers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Azure Networking services
Virtual Network -- Computers communicating with each other located on same network

Subnet -- sub division of these networks {these subnets have diff security settings for frontend servers,backedn server,database servers}
It is a way of dividing ur own virtual network into security zones

Vpn - connecting ur home network to ur office network

Express Route - very fast and private . Eg when using azure services u can connect ur corporate network to these azure networks
whihc are highly encrypted

Dns -  take ur domain name and host it on azure

Monitoring Management tools --> Azure Monitor Network Watcher And Express Route


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Virtual Machines - important key concepts
images are like operating systems
VM famiy -- Choose the right hardware
Vm Size -- cpus ram
Disks

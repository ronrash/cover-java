//    We need to handle resource sharing and synchronization to solve a few complexities:
//
//    Synchronization on queue while adding and removing data
//    On queue empty, the consumer has to wait until the producer adds new data to the queue
//    When the queue is full, the producer has to wait until the consumer consumes data and the queue has some empty buffer

    // In Java threads use blockingQueue

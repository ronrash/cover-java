 To deploy a docker image to kubernetes clsuer
 # 1. we need to create a deployement
    -->    kubectl create deployment credit-k8-deployment --image=rondocker2191/credit-card

       kubectl expose deployment credit-k8-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=8082
       kubectl expose deployment hello-world-rest-api --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080



   3. If we want to update the deployement

      kubectl set image deployment credit-k8-deployment credit-card=imagename

       check the pod s

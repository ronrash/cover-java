producer with keys and callbacks
 create the properties ie set the properties to connect to the kafka server
 Properties properties = new Properties();
        properties.setProperty("bootstrap.servers", "cluster.playground.cdkt.io:9092");
        properties.setProperty("security.protocol", "SASL_SSL");
        properties.setProperty("sasl.jaas.config", "org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username=\"5ShaBfKcZ7qe77pRgo6fTd\" password=\"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2F1dGguY29uZHVrdG9yLmlvIiwic291cmNlQXBwbGljYXRpb24iOiJhZG1pbiIsInVzZXJNYWlsIjpudWxsLCJwYXlsb2FkIjp7InZhbGlkRm9yVXNlcm5hbWUiOiI1U2hhQmZLY1o3cWU3N3BSZ282ZlRkIiwib3JnYW5pemF0aW9uSWQiOjc2NzE1LCJ1c2VySWQiOjg5MjUzLCJmb3JFeHBpcmF0aW9uQ2hlY2siOiJjNTNiZTJlYS0wNDk5LTRmYTctYmQ3NS1iZDVkOGYxYTBkMGIifX0.0nndoLgLTKgm3GJ2pfO22kQbAWgY93p704z7sAFPUQY\";");

Producer acknolegemet
acks=0 means producer will not wait for acknowledgement
acks=1 -->prodcuer will wait fro leader
acks=all prodcuer will wait fro leaders and replicas

min.insync.replicas=1: only the leader has to acknowledge
min.insync.replicas=2:  the leader and one replica has to acknowledge

this is the bare min , so that if the leader fails there is atleast one backup

Kafka Topic Avialabilty
acks=all and min.insync.replicas=2: this is recommended becoz we can afford for atleast on broker to go down

that is why we should have a replication factor of 3 which means 3 partitions across 3 differemt serves
the leader and the replicass will have to acknowledge ,, we will never loose data
Producer retry -- incase of failure
retries settings
retries = min.insync.replicas

Prodcuer timeout
delivery.timeout.ms=120000 = 2 mins

max.in.flight.requests.per.connection default -=5

Idempotent prodcuer - makes sure no duplicate request are sent
settings are default from kafka 3.0
retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE(2^31)
max.in.flight.requests=1  kafka version<1
max.in.flight.requests=5  kafka version>5

these setting are automatically applied after ur producer has started
we can set properties prodcuerProps.put("enable.idempotence",true)

what is the best prodcuer settings, since kafka 3.0 all the setting are by default but here is the below list

acks=all
min.insync.replicas =2 boker/topic level - ensure atleast 2 brokers are ther
enable.idempotence=true
retries=MAX_INT ()
retry until delivery.timeout.ms is reached
delivery.timeout.ms=120000 = 2 mins
max.in.flight.requests.per.connection default = 5 ensures max performance while keeping message ordering




Message compression in brokers -- compress messages by producer
compression.type can be gzip,lz4,snappy,zstd

compression.type=prodcuer -- the broker takes the compressed batch from the prodcuer client an writes the data to topics log file.
compression.type=none     ---> all batches are decompressed by the broker
compression.type=lz4 --> batches are compressed by the broker and the recompressed using compression algorithm

it consumes more cpu cycles

Improve the batching
linger.ms and batch.size ??
kafka producers send messages to the kafka brokers asap, it will have max.in.flight.request.per.connections=5 ie
5 batches are in flight (being sent between prodcuer and kafka broker), if more messages are to be sent kafka is smart to start
batching before next batch is sent  this helps increase thruput with very low latency

linger.ms defualt =0 is how much time to wait before the next batch is sent, if we increase the time ,, more batch size can be sent at expense of latecny
if batch is filled within liner,ms ,, increse bacth size

batch.size is 16 kb -max no of bytes per batch
msg > batch will not be bacthed ,coz batch is per partition ,so do not set th batch size to number like 32 or 6b kb or  too high ,, it wasts memory

high thruput ??
if linger.ms is high ,, prodcue will have time for bigger batch size and if tehre is spae memory increase batch size,, since u can monitor the batch and liner,ms
